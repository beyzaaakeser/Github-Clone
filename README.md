<h1>Github Clone Website</h1>

I developed a frontend using HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a clone of GitHub's user profile page. This project allows GitHub to view and drill down into users' profiles. It displays basic information like a profile picture, number of followers and followings, list of repos, and other profile details.

<h2> The following technologies were used in the frontend development phase of my site: </h2>
